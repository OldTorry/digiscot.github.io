## Project plan

### Project description

Teaching the folk of Torry basic computing skills to: combat social isolation; connect them with services; increase employability and improve general wellbeing.


## Project milestones

### Phase 1 January 2015

Engage with community partners to agree the promotion of the project

Purchase printer and laptops. Create documents to compliment tuition. Create questionnaires to quantify student progress. Promote courses.

### Phase 2 February & March 2015

Documentation printed, computers set up. Start classes. Maximum number of people at this early stage will be 5 people on 5 Chromebooks. This phase will allow us to ascertain whether the next phase of purchases should be desktops, laptops, or tablets. There will be at least five hours of tuition per week during this phase, split in whichever way best suits our clients.

### Phase 3 April, May, June 2015

Using the knowledge we have gained from Phase 3, we will expand our classes in whichever way we think will benefit the local community the most. This may be in the form of: larger classes, mixed device classes, specific device classes, specific skill classes, or specific demographic classes. We may also provide outreach classes, depending on manpower. The relevant documentation will be created for whichever direction we will go in, and questionnaires will continue to be used to quantify the progress of the project.

## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

We are happy to say that we were able to help some Torry folk overcome their fear of computers, and learn enough skills to be able to navigate the internet comfortably. The demographic mainly consisted of the 50-80 age group, the retired, and those looking for work. I was able to provided six hours of tuition per week for 12 months.


Overall this project X, Y, Z.
In terms of outputs we delivered six hours of tuition per week for 12 months, for local residents to access. We’ve established permanent computing facilities at the community centre, and a loan-a-laptop service.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has helped people overcome their fear of computers, learn how to use a computer to navigate the internet, use email, use a search engine, research subjects of interest, find useful information, write a CV, look for employment, increase their social interaction and make friends.

We know this through one-on-one interaction with the users of the service we have been able to provide.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

The decision to purchase Chrome OS devices was particularly successful. Not only did they require zero maintenance, the guest mode reassured the users that any data they entered would be safe, as sessions are deleted after the user logs off. This was useful in overcoming the fear that some new users had.

The desktop machines were particularly good for those with poor eyesight. We had desks custom made so that the six machines could be available to anyone using the centre (we have a very diverse range of classes and groups throughout the week). The laptops were less popular for centre users (and of course couldn’t be left unattended), but we have established a loan-a-laptop service for those transitioning from tutored use to home use (Torry is one of the most deprived areas of Aberdeen, and even a cheap computer is beyond the means of many residents). Again, the Chromebooks are ideal for this purpose (though we would get black ones next time as they are easier to keep clean!). 

One thing that worked well was the social nature of the classes. They were very useful in overcoming social isolation, and users really did look forward to coming along once a week.

Putting the classes on at the same time as Stan (the representative from Pathways) was at the centre (Thursdays 10am-4pm) was a particularly good use of resources. It is not uncommon for those looking for work (particularly the long term unemployed) to lack basic computer skills, and it was therefore a good environment for him to encourage them to use the computers with assistance. 

The computers have also been useful for our ongoing Torry Heritage project, which is aiming to digitally archive photos, stories, audio, and video. We are being assisted by Robert Gordon’s University and the Station House Media Unit in this regard. The computers provide a way for the people of Torry to access the online archive. The printer that has been bought with the award’s funds has made it possible to streamline the photo archiving process, too.

Things that we would do differently next time:

I did underestimate the amount of one-on-one time required for each user. More volunteers would have helped, but we have found that suitable people are hard to come by. The lack of personnel was the reason why we were unable to do the outreach to Torry’s sheltered accommodation facilities, as we had initially hoped.

One other thing I would have pushed more was the quantification of the outcomes. 

The centre will continue to provide access to the machines, but tuition has been suspended due to my own health issues. We are on the lookout for another volunteer.
